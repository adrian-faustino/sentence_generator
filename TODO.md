## Linguistics:

[x] Research how Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, Bixby, etc, is used in Japanese

## Main App:

[] refactor list of strings to be list of objects for ease of adding attributes to a word later (jp,eng, verb tense) etc

## Observations:

#### English:

- "play me X" vs "put on me X", some verbs require "for" in the imperative. Use conditionals?

#### Japanese:

- For Japanese verbs, a good approach would be to make each verb into an object with its conjugations as the attributes, as well as irregular/regular verb status, etc
